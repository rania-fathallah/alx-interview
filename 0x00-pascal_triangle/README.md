# 0x00 Pascal Triangle

Welcome to the **0x00 Pascal Triangle** project! This repository contains implementations and solutions related to generating Pascal's Triangle, a classic problem in computer science and mathematics.

## Project Overview

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This project explores various approaches to generating Pascal's Triangle and understanding its properties.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. For example, if the input is `5`, the output should be:
[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]

## Algorithm

1. **Input Representation**: Accept an integer `n`, which represents the number of rows.
2. **Row Generation**: Use a loop to build each row based on the previous row.
3. **Output**: Print or return the generated triangle in the desired format.
